People love measuring things. We’re constantly looking for ways to make analysis less subjective, and apply hard data to decision making. Too much measuring, though, leads to oversimplification.

Ask an economist and they‘ll tell you how unpredictable large economies are. Programmers will tell you that making computer programs is easy until you account for the humans who use them, because even software, codified into indisputably binary flows, must interact with the systems around it. The smallest, simplest system is always part of a larger one, inextricably intertwined. 

People don’t behave anything like software (maybe [the mice were on to something][1]).

Metrics are useful, though. Hard data simplifies. It reduces the cognitive load during decision making, and diminishes accountability – it’s not your fault when it doesn’t work out, as long as you go with the stats.

Difficult decisions are tiring, and we’re generally not very good at dealing with the emotional consequences of getting them wrong. We seek to replace subjective consideration with algorithms, and to have indisputable data on hand to justify each and every commitment. Given such pressures, statistics begin to feel like an analeptic tonic, alleviating stress and restoring a comfortable state of being. 

Opiates might be a better analogy. We’re heavily addicted, dazed and confused, and thinking only as far as the next hit, the next chance to measure and optimise. The desperation creeps in and, eager to find ever more opportunities to let the numbers dull the pain, we become less able to intuit better answers. We start to see only the numbers. We persuade ourselves that metrics provide us with a more accurate picture of reality when in fact they abstract and simplify to a point of such distortion that our perception of the world becomes hopelessly skewed. Our collective grip on reality begins to slip.

Eventually we build and optimise systems that have no connection to their original purpose. We build schools that are optimised to churn out maximum grades, and economic systems optimised for profit. These things may be somewhat useful indicators, but they’re lazy objectives, constructed by our addiction to the comfort of the statistic. Easy, measurable targets.

Neither grades nor profit are broad indicators of value. Relative to the gamut of things that make up the human condition, both are microscopically specific, measuring tiny fractions of our existence. I don’t care about grades. I do care about inquisitive kids with a thirst for the world around them and a desire to contribute to the society they live in. Unfortunately, these things are impossible to accurately represent as a figure on a standardised scale, and so we divert our systems, attention and resources away from such difficult, fuzzy objectives, toward those more easily measured. 

This isn’t an anti-metrics rant. Metrics, like opiates, can be useful. Abuse is commonplace, however, and since abuse of metrics is socially acceptable, the highest levels of decision makers – those with the most pressure to make decisions well – tend to be the worst afflicted.

I’m not sure how we break out of this abusive use of tests and measures. An obvious place to start might be identifying methods, processes and incentives that exist only to improve the numbers. A solution focussed on a metric, rather than something that actually matters, often indicates an over-abstracted problem.
